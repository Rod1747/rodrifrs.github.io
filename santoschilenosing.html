            Luis Alberto Miguel Hurtado Cruchaga was born in Viña del Mar, into an impoverished aristocratic family. At the age of 4, his father passed away, leaving Alberto and his younger brother in the care of their mother, together with whom they moved to Santiago, at the home of some uncles.

       <br>
            Despite his young age, his only vocation has been the priesthood, he studied Law at the Catholic University, graduating at the age of twenty-two. Only days after completing this career, he entered the Jesuit novitiate in Chillán, beginning the profession that constituted his genuine vocation.
             <br>
            <h1>Social work</h1>
            <br>            
            He worked as a professor at the San Ignacio school and at the Catholic University of Chile, where he also contributed to the creation of the Faculty of Theology. On October 9, 1938, he laid the first stone of the Novitiate and the House of Retreats in Morocco, which currently bears the name of Father Hurtado in his honor. In 1941 he was appointed advisor to the Catholic Youth Action, a position in which he would work with the Bishop of Talca, Monsignor Manuel Larraín Errázuriz, who was his partner. The bishop ordered Hurtado to resign from the Catholic Action consultancy. "Father Hurtado", faithful to the vow of obedience, accepted the resignation. However, Hurtado is believed to have been heavily influenced by the Falange Nacional, which later became the Christian Democratic Party of Chile, although Father Hurtado himself denied any links to the Falange.

             <br>
            After his participation in the youth world, he dedicated himself to helping the poorest. Thus, a campaign began, mainly in the newspaper El Mercurio, which led to the foundation of the Hogar de Cristo. On December 21, 1944, he laid the first stone for the construction of the foundation's headquarters, located on Bernal del Mercado street, in the Central Station district.
            In June 1945, he founded the Chilean Trade Union and Economic Action (ASICH). Despite the initial reluctance of the Episcopal Conference that it be used as a trench for communism within the Church, it was recognized by the Church in 1950. On October 8, 1947, he was received by Pope Pius XII, whom he asked for help to prepare union labor leaders and young employers in Catholic thought and the social doctrine of the Church.

            <h1>Last days and later death</h1>
            <br>
            At the end of 1950, Father Hurtado began to feel severe pain in his waist. He was treated by Rodolfo Armas Cruz, one of the greatest doctors of the time in Chile, who detected pancreatic cancer that was already incurable due to how advanced it was. However, his death did not mean the end of his teachings and messages: the Hogar de Cristo became the largest charity institution in Chile and an icon for the young, the poor, the elderly and workers.
